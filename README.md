# CubeWave
I saw a video online about someone using the P5.js library and after watching the video I was pretty interested in what you could do with it. So I did some research and played a little with the library. Later on I created a grid of cubes, these cubes are be made bigger and smaller with a different offset wich gives the "Wave" effect.
